# Task 4.2
### Analyse similarity of brain RSMs to SentenceTransformer encoded instruction RSM

## [brain.py](./brain.py)
- Holds the `Brain` class which does all the loading, filtering, and analyses for this task

## [main.py](./main.py)
- Just the main script, should probably add some Namespace arguments, but for now it just has static in-file inputs to create and use a `Brain` class object.
